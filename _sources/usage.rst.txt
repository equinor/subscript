Using subscript
===============

In Equinor, all subscript utilities are installed on all Linux
computers and are available in every user's path when Komodo is activated::

  source /prog/res/komodo/stable/enable.csh

Remove the ``.csh`` from the line above if you are using *bash* (recommended).

For installation on non-Equinor computers, create and activate a Python
virtual environment and run::

  pip install subscript
