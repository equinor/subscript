# On pythonpath:
#
# RMS version are major.minor.micro
#
# One can expect in 95% of cases that micro version of RMS will use same
# python library as the previous micro version, e.g. RMS 11.1.2 should
# use same as RMS 11.1.1 etc. Usually there is a symlink in /project/res/roxapi
# that shows this. However, it is possible of making this more fine-grained
# _if needed_ (that e.g. 99.1.2 uses a slightly different python library than
# 99.1.1).
# So pythonpath is given as list, where first is highest priority. If folder is
# not found, then it will be omitted from the list.
