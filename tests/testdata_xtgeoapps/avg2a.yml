# Case with filters, read dates from global config, and omitting "zonation" (use
# a zone filter instead)

input:
  eclroot: ../xtgeo-testdata/3dgrids/reek/REEK
  grid: $eclroot.EGRID

  # alternative approach to read a variables and dates:

# For filters, there are properties defined at the same grid layout as
# the grid read in input
#
# If several filters, they will be cumulative.
#
# In this case a ZONE filter is used instead of an explicit "zonation" setting; need
# in most cases to be combined with "prefix" setting under "output"

filters:
  -
    name: PORO
    source: $eclroot.INIT
    intvrange: [0.0, 1.0]  # Filter for a continuous will be an interval
  -
    name: FACIES
    discrete: Yes
    source: ../xtgeo-testdata/3dgrids/reek/reek_sim_facies2.roff
    discrange: [2]  # Filter for a discrete will be spesic number sequence
  -
    name: Zone
    discrete: Yes
    source: ../xtgeo-testdata/3dgrids/reek/reek_sim_zone.roff
    discrange: [2, 3]  # Filter for a discrete will be spesic number sequence

computesettings:
  zone: No
  all: Yes
  mask_zeros: Yes  # means that ouput maps will be set to undef where zero

# map definition (unrotated maps only, for rotated maps use a maptemplate...)
