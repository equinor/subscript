# Zonation gives what zones to compute over, and typically is similar
# to the zonation in RMS. Note that it is possible to read the zonation
# from an extrernal YAML file, via:
#   yamlfile: 'name_of_file.yml'
zonation:
  # zranges will normally be the Zone parameter, defined as K range cells
  zranges:
    - Z1: [1, 5]
    - Z2: [6, 10]
    - Z3: [11, 14]
