Using subscript
===============

In Equinor, all subscript utilities are installed on all Linux
computers, and is available in every users path when Komodo is activated::

  source /prog/res/komodo/stable/enable.csh

Other users can install using Python setuptools, typically
in a virtual environment. Some subscript tools depend on software
only on Equinor Linux computers and these will not work.
