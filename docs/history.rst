Subscript took over where ResScript left. ResScript worked within
Statoil/Equinor as an internal git repository for sharing scripts between
subsurface people from its inception in ~2013 to end of Python2 in 2020. For the
Python 2 to Python 3 transition, code quality and requirements have been
elevated in order to increase maintainability.
