Subscript is Equinors collection of scripts used for subsurface reservoir
modelling.

Using subscript
===============

In Equinor, all subscript utilities are installed on all Linux
computers, and are available in every users path when Komodo is activated::

  source /prog/res/komodo/stable/enable.csh

Remove the ``.csh`` from the line above if you are using *bash* (recommended).

Other users can install using Python setuptools as a developer. Some subscript
tools depend on software only on Equinor Linux computers and these will not
work.
